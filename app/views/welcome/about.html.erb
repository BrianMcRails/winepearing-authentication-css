          <h4>Our Basis.</h4>
          <p>Wine stimiulates taste, scent, touch, and sight. As a self proclaimed audiophile and wine appreciator, I believe that with a little attention to detail the gap is easily bridged to combine all 5 senses in one harmonious experience.</p>

          <h4>What we do.</h4>
          <p>Every month we will ship to you and your loved one near or far a package containing a bottle of wine and a playlist specifically curated to compliment that bottle. Throw on the album, pop the cork and enjoy wine like you never have before. The music's not bad either ;).</p>

          <h4>There's more!</h4>
          <p>Why experience this alone? With our one of the kind service you can share this experience with your loved ones wherever they live! One subscription includes two shipments, one to you and one to the recipient of your choosing. They are scheduled to arrive the same day so you can phone, facetime, text, email, tweet, instagram, facebook, or snapchat the experience with your daughter, son, grandchildren, parents, grandparents, and even just your friends!</p>
